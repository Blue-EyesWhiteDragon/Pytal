A Vital preset downloader.

And no it doesn't scroll down, yet.

And no it's not for MacOS or Linux users, yet.

## Installation ##

Requires: Python 3, Windows (for now)

There is a `install_python` batch file that uses Powershell and Chocolately package manager (also will be installed) to install Python 3

After you have Python installed or if you already have it installed:

Run install_requirements to install the required python modules! or run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` on your shell of choice.

You can now either run `python {folder of this project}` outside the directory or `python __main__.py` inside the directory!

Have fun,

BEWD.
